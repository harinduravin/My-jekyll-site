I"ˆ<p>JSON Web Token (JWT) defines a container to transport data between interested parties. It became an IETF standard in May 2015 with the RFC 7519. There are multiple applications of JWT. The OpenID Connect is one of them. In OpenID Connect the id token is represented as a JWT. Both in securing APIs and Microservices, the JWT is used as a way to propagate and verify end-user identity.</p>
