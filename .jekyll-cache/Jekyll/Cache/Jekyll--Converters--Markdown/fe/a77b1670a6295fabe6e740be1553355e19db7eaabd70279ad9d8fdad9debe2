I"`<p>The five subjects explained below are quite specific to CFA studies. All of them were completely new for me when I started. Iâ€™m trying to explain these subjects from the view point of a level 1 exam completed student. I hope it would be an interesting view point to look at the curriculum, when getting ready to start working on level 1 exam.</p>
